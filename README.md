# Distrack - Minimal collection tracker application

## About

While the intended usage leans towards tracking collectibles, Distrack can be used for various reasons, including, but not limited to: Listing stuff, making plans, the classic to-do list functionality, value list for some games (has a few features supporting this since the initial idea was to create a value list tool). Long story short, literally anything that involves collectibles and data.

Distrack, being a small application, puts it's specifically crafted features to maximum use, with support for distinctive collections with detailed collectibles, rich filtering, tag system, etc...

## Installation

The application can be installed from the releases section, where a few zip files can be found. Choose based on your operating system. Simply extract whichever zip file you download and run the Distrack.Api/Distrack.Api.exe file that you'll find inside of it. I recommend creating a shortcut for ease of access.

As of now, Distrack runs in a browser, locally. Sort of like the web version of Jupyter Notebooks, it opens the terminal application and keeps it going while it's running.

## Technologies

The Distrack API is built on the .NET Framework (.NET 8).

For the frontend I used React with Vite, and Chakra v3 for styling.

As for the database, I went with SQLite. The application uses a single database file for storing everything (except for images which are stored in their own separate folder).
